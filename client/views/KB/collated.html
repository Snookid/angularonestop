              <p>Your survey has binary answers for the screening question (Question {}) such as "Yes/No", "True/False", "Agree/Disagree". We would like to suggest that you have more than two answer choices.
                   For example: {INSERT EXAMPLE HERE} 
  
                  We have done validations that have shown incidence accuracy is better when binary questions are not used. Having three answers or more help eliminate confusion for the respondents, provides a better user experience, and improves survey quality.

              <li>Superlatives regarding <b>FACTS</b> would <b>need an opt-out</b>. The superlative in the cigarette question was predefined by a factual situation which can't be fact for everyone. </li>

             <p>Example:</p>
             <p>>What do you like the most in your office? <b><i>(opt-out needed, not everyone works in an office)</i></b></p>

              <br>
            
              <li>For answer choices that are of <b>usage in a logical order</b>, you can either suggest an opt out <b>OR</b> edit one of the answer choices that can serve as an opt out.</li>

                <br>

              <i>"Bowel movement</i>" is accepted as Not/Non-gruesome. However, this would still be treated on a case-to-case basis depending on the content of the survey. For bowel movement surveys, ensure that there are no gross items included in the survey and check if it is for medical purposes. If for medical purposes, include a permission screen.
              <i>Note</i>: Please asses if the survey is adult enough. Most birth control (contraceptive) surveys are adult. If unsure, you can always <u>escalate</u>.

            <li><b>Take</b>: Generally, breast augmentation can be classified as "invasive" medical procedure which per Program Policy is not allowed [Repulsive Content].</li>
            <li><b>Reservations</b>: It is widely accepted and considered by many (<u>especially in the US) as a regular, non-taboo cosmetic procedure</u>. Thus, can be deemed as good to start but needs permission question</li>

                         1. If a survey is asking “Have you ever been convicted of a crime” is not allowed due to its senstive nature, how come do we allow such survey examples [stealing, detention or any criminal]?

                         <font color="#99ffff">- "Being convicted of a crime and the act of doing something or the thought of doing something that may or may not be a crime are two different things. <b>Asking about past criminal record is not allowed."</b></font>

                  <li>In any case, we may allow surveys with abortion to start as long as its written without being repulsive, push polling, or with proper screening questions with other policy related questions.
</li>
                  <li>We can escalate abortion subject surveys if you are not sure but if it is obvious it is repulsive or push polling or only about abortion itself then we will stick to the current policy.
</li>
                  <li>If the survey has other policy questions then we can easily assume the intention is for policy polling but if the survey is just about abortion then it's questionable their intention of use.</li>
                  
                  <li>Example:</li>
                  <li> <i>"Are you in favor of abortion?"</i> - <b>Policy poll</b>; needs "I prefer not to say"</li>
                  <li><i>"Have you had an abortion?"</i> - <b>Sensitive Subject</b></li>
                  <li>If the answer choices are in Ranges, it's good to go without "I prefer not to say" <font color="#ffb84d">(8/18/15)</font></li>

"Hating an idea, concept, tshirt design, car is okay, just as long as it doesn't violate the above policy. You have to always follow the stated policy. That's foolproof. If you had a tshirt design of a smurf and mushroom that could be a "I hate it and I love it" ratings. But, if the tshirt design had an image that says "Hitler is a hero" or "let's start a war with Russia" it's very obvious those are not allowed due to hate. You can start the surveys with "I hate it" to "I love it" as long as they follow our content policies. Remember, every survey is different! There is no general rule that because this subject or topic was previously allowed, it can be allowed again if it violated our content policies."
